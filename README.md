**_Data Analysis_** study I did using **_Regression and Analysis of Variance_** I fit my model into **_Simple Linear Regression_** and **_Multiple Linear Regression_**, I go on further investigation of the weights aka **_model diagnostics_** by looking for **_leverage and influence points_** and clean out any **_outliers_** I also show graphs corresponding to my analysis of **_residuals_**, I plotted them in various methods to analyze if any **_Normality Assumptions_** were **_violated_**, I proceed to try out different **__data transformations_** and further analyze the residuals to see if they help improve the model. I also analyze some of the data using **_Factor Analysis_** for **_discrete_** cases of the variable

My **_Rmarkdown file_** is compared into a **_PDF_** format found in DataAnalysis.pdf
